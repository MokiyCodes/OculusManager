# Oculus Manager
Manage (see if they exist, and kill them) your Oculus Background Processes with ease.

## What? Why?
Oculus' (proprietary) Software, on windows, keeps drivers and helper processes running in the background, even after closing the app.<br/>
It additionally starts the driver on system startup, which makes no sense if you don't use your headset 24/7, and even then, starting the app automatically starts this driver anyway.<br/>
This driver starts within seconds, so why is it running in the background 24/7?

The answer is likely Facebook/Meta tracking you.

## What is Oculus Manager
Oculus Manager is a simple process to kill all (known) Oculus-related processes with the click of 2 buttons (start program, click `Kill Oculus`).

## How do I use Oculus Manager?
Simply download the [Installer](), and run it.<br/><br/>
Windows (>8) will likely prompt you with "This application was blocked for your safety" or something. If you read closer, it's because it can't confirm who published it.<br/>
This is normal, since I did not "digitally sign" the installer, or the program, since I don't have a widely trusted certificate, and don't want to pay >$200/year for one.<br/>
Simply ignore the warning, click `Read More`, then `Run Anyway`.
